# Deploy Jenkins Server

To deploy Jenkins CI server using docker, you need to run the following commands.

## Pull the official Docker Image

```bash
$ docker pull jenkins/jenkins:lts   # long-term support build
```

Visit: [Jenkins | Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/jenkins/jenkins)

## Give Persistent Storage for Jenkins

All the user data generated by our Jenkins container will be persisted by using __Docker Volumes__. This will ensure that our configurations, credentials and other saved data are protected when the container goes down.

```bash
$ docker volume create jenkins-home
```

Visit: [Docker Volumes | aws.plainenglish.io](https://aws.plainenglish.io/the-ultimate-guide-to-docker-volumes-812498a4d996)


## Virtual Network for Jenkins

If you want to a standalone CI server then you can skip this step. A virtual network makes communication between the CI server and the jenkins agents easier.

```bash
$ docker network create --driver=bridge --subnet=172.30.0.0/24 jenkins-vnet
```

## Run the Container

```bash
docker run -itd --rm --name=jenkins-ci \
  --network=jenkins-vnet \
  -p 8080:8080/tcp \
  -p 50000:50000 \
  -v jenkins-home:/var/jenkins_home \
  jenkins/jenkins:lts
```

## Access the Logs for One Time Password

On it's first start up, Jenkins will ask you for a __One-Time Password__, it is needed to unlock the Jenkins admin creation page.

```
$ docker logs jenkins-ci
```

## Access the Dashboard

Visit: http://localhost:8080 to access Jenkins. First you have to unlock it using the one time password mentioned in the [above step](#access-the-logs-for-one-time-password).
